#  MeteoApp
 MeteoApp is an app that shows the weather forecast or patterns of a given location

## About

- One can sign up and log into the application using their google  accounts
- Users can search for a location on earth
- The app should be able to return the weather casts for specified days by the users .
-  The weather cast results should be represented by images.for example, sunny weather should be represented by an         image of the sun.
- Users should be able to store the queried data for future use
- Users should be to delete the stored data.
## Motivation

  Most weather apps provide forecast, users don't get a chance to look at the past weather patterns of a given a location. 

  A world is currently experiencing global warming and its becoming hard to tell if for example the rainy seasons are shorter or its hotter.
  The app would provide weather patterns to farmers to aid them to know when to plant and harvest.It would help Green energy activists make a case for their cause with data.
